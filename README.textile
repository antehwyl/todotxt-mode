h1. Emacs Major Mode for TODO.TXT files

A major mode for editing "todo.txt":http://www.todotxt.com files.

The mode provides commands for:

* toggling the done status of a tag
* setting, changing or deleting a task's priority
* opening the default @todo.txt@ file or add todos to the file
* archiving done tasks
* looking/grouping for specific markup (project, tags, persons)
* looking/grouping by date

The last two functions work if special markup is used in the todos.

h2. Classification of todos

Use the following syntax in a todo:

* +project to specify that a todo belongs to project "project"
* @person to specify that a todo pertains to person "person"
* #tag to tag a todo with "tag"

*Example*

<pre>
  2011-11-23 send email to @mark concerning project +world_domination #important
</pre>

h2. Managing dates and deadlines

@todotxt@ supports an extension to the todo.txt syntax that allows to specify due dates, start dates, and repetitions. In particular, anywhere in the text of a todo you can use:

* @d:2012-03-05@ to specify that the todo is due on March 5, 2012.
* @t:2012-02-16@ to specify that the todo can be started no earlier than February 16, 2012.
* @r:3.months@ to specify that the todo is to be repeated three months after its @DUE@ date (note: if @RECUR@ is present, then also a @DUE@ date has to be specified in the todo).

Possible repetition patterns:

* @daily@, @weekly@, @monthly@, @yearly@
* @N.days@, @N.weeks@, @N.months@, @N.years@ for more flexibly repetition periods (also the singular forms can be used, e.g. @1.day@).


h1. Installation

Load (or add to your path and require) @todotxt-mode@ in your @.emacs@ file.  

For instance, put in your @.emacs@ file:

<pre>
 (add-to-list 'load-path "<DIR WHERE TODOTXT-MODE LIVES>")
 (require 'todotxt-mode)
</pre>

h1. Usage

Open a @todo.txt@ file in Emacs and then

<pre>
  M-x todotxt-mode
</pre>

When in @todo.txt@ mode, use @M-x describe-mode@ for more information about available functions and keybindings.

Some commands you might want to try:

<pre>
  M-x todotxt-highlight-dated-todos  
  M-x todotxt-group-by-date 
  M-x todotxt-search-by-project
  M-x todotxt-archive
</pre>

h1. Configuration

You might want to put the following code in your @.emacs@ file:

<pre>
(setq todotxt-default-file (expand-file-name "<<WHERE YOUR TODO FILE LIVES>>"))
(define-key global-map "\C-co" 'todotxt-open-file)
(define-key global-map "\C-ct" 'todotxt-add-todo)
</pre>

to quickly access your @todo.txt@ file and quickly add todos to it.

If you do *not* want to prepend creation date to newly created todos, change the value of @todotxt-prepend-today-date@ to nil:

<pre>
(setq todotxt-prepend-today-date nil) ; do not prepend creation date to todos
</pre>
